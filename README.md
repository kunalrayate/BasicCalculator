# üî¢ Basic Calculator - Java Console Application

# Overview
Basic Calculator is a simple Java console-based application designed to perform fundamental arithmetic operations. Built with core Java, it features a user-friendly, menu-driven interface for basic calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It handles invalid inputs gracefully using exception handling mechanisms, making it robust and beginner-friendly.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features and Operations
1.Addition

Allows users to add two integer numbers.

2.Subtraction

Performs subtraction of two user-provided integers.

3.Multiplication

Multiplies two numbers and returns the result.

4.Division

Divides one number by another with validation to prevent division by zero.

5.Exit

Ends the program gracefully.

## üßÆ Attributes / Functional Highlights
User Input Validation
Handles invalid inputs using try-catch blocks (InputMismatchException, ArithmeticException).

Looped Menu Interface
Provides a continuous loop for multiple calculations until the user chooses to exit.

Exception Handling
Prevents crashes due to incorrect data types or invalid mathematical operations.

## üß∞ Technologies Used
Java: Core language for implementing the calculator logic and menu interface.

Scanner Class: For reading user input from the console.

Exception Handling (try-catch): To ensure smooth program flow on invalid inputs.

Eclipse IDE / IntelliJ IDEA: Recommended IDEs for developing and running the project.

Git: For version control and pushing code to GitHub.
